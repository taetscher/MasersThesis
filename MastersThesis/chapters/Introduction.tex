		\subsection{Sustainable Development}
    		This section introduces the concept of Sustainable Development (SD). After a brief overview of its origins, some of the many important steps in the adoption of SD into today's global politics by the United Nations are highlighted before various key models are introduced. Finally some of the current measures used to globally advance efforts of SD are presented.
		
		    \subsubsection{Origins of Sustainable Development}
		        Ulrich \citet{grober2007} describes how today's notion of Sustainable Development originated from the concept of Sustainability. Grober further elaborates on how the term "Sustainability" was first introduced to the domain of forestry through Hanns-Carl von Carlowitz \citet{voncarlowitz1732} with his \textit{magnum opus} "Sylvicultura Oeconomica" in which he described the necessity of a controlled and sustained use of timber. Timber was an essential resource at the time, that could not be substituted. According to Grober (\citeyear{grober2007}:18), von Carlowitz criticized "the contemporary short-termed way of thinking which was centred solely on making money", thus emphasizing that society should assure a steady supply of timber through conservation and reforestation efforts in order to guarantee the continual and sustained use of the resource.
		        \medskip
		        
		        The following centuries saw authors like Thomas Robert Malthus (\citeyear{malthus1926}) and George Perkins Marsh (\citeyear{marsh1965}) as well as the Club of Rome (\citeyear{meadows1972a}) publish concerns about human overpopulation, resource shortages and a possible system collapse of the world as it was. In The Limits to growth, Donella Meadows and the Club of Rome (\citeyear{meadows1972a}:23) concluded that "if the present growth trends in world population, industrialization, pollution, food production, and resource depletion continue unchanged, the limits to growth on this planet will be reached sometime within the next one hundred years. The most probable result will be a rather sudden and uncontrollable decline in both population and industrial capacity". Jacobus A. du Pisani (\citeyear{dupisani2006}) gives a comprehensive and detailed overview of this period in the history of the idea of Sustainable Development and the various theories on development and progress that preceded it.
		        \medskip
		        
		        More than 200 years would pass after Carlowitz' concerns until the modern notion of Sustainable Development was introduced formally into global politics. Michael \citet{redclift2005} explains that through the report on global environment and development by the \textit{Brundtland Commission}, or "World Commission on Environment and Development" (\citeyear{wced1987}), the term "Sustainable Development" was introduced into political vocabulary. Gro Harlem Brundtland (\citeyear{brundtland1987}:292),  who headed the commission, defines Sustainable Development as development that meets "[...] the needs and aspirations of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs".
		        
		        
		    
		    \subsubsection{Sustainable Development as a Geopolitical Paradigm}
		        The Brundtland definition is the cornerstone of Sustainable Development as it is known today. And while it was the Brundtland Report that introduced SD into political agendas arond the world, the need for specific, quantifiable goals to work towards arose \citep{dupisani2006}. Shantayanan Devarajan et al. (\citeyear{devarajan2002}) as well as David Hulme (\citeyear{hulme2009}) illustrate the progression from just the idea of SD, through major stepping-stones like the \textit{United Nations Conference on Environment and Development} in Rio de Janeiro (in 1992), the \textit{International Conference on Population and Development} in Cairo (in 1994) and the \textit{World Summit on Social Development} in Copenhagen (in 1995), to the first major global development framework: the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
		        
		        \medskip
		        
		        The MDGs were introduced in September 2000 at the \textit{United Nations Millennium Summit} in New York City (UN General Assembly, \citeyear{ungeneralassembly2000}). These Goals were aimed at issues of poverty, hunger, primary education, gender equality, child mortality, maternal health, preventable diseases, environmental sustainability and a global partnership for development. Towards the end of the 15 year period of the MDGs, Jeffrey David Sachs (\citeyear{sachs2012}:2206) states that "developing countries have made substantial progress towards achievement of the MDGs, although the progress is highly variable across goals, countries, and regions". He further explains how the world has entered a new geological epoch in which human activity has become the most dominant force in fundamental earth dynamics. While this notion is not universally accepted, it illustrates a further shift in societal consciousness towards Sustainable Development \citep{heikkurinen2019}. Sachs (\citeyear{sachs2012}:2207) further argues that "in view of [...] dire and unprecedented challenges, the need for urgent, high-profile, and change-producing global goals should be obvious". The MDGs brought sustainability onto the global political main stage and turned Sustainable Development into a geopolitical paradigm. Yet most of the challenges the MDGs were addressing persisted at least to some degree past their expiration date \citep{sachs2012}.
		        

		    \subsubsection{17 Goals to Transform Our World}
	            
	            Because of these persistent challenges, the UN General Assembly adopted the new 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Developments on 25 September 2015 \citep{unitednations2018}. The new agenda consists of 17 goals and includes 169 subordinate targets, making it the most extensive global development framework to date (UN Statistics Division, \citeyear{unitednationsstatisticsdivision2019a}). Compared to the MDGs, the SDGs cover more dimensions of development more specifically (see table X). In March of 2018 as well as one year later in March of 2019, the list of indicators for the SDGs was expanded to 232 total indicators (UN Statistics Division, \citeyear{unitednationsstatisticsdivision2019}). All indicators are classified in terms of three tier levels:
	            
	            \medskip
	            \begin{tcolorbox}
    				\textbf{Tier I:} Indicator is conceptually clear, has an internationally established methodology and standards are available, and data are regularly produced by countries for at least 50 per cent of countries and of the population in every region where the indicator is relevant.
    				\medskip
    				
    				\textbf{Tier II:} Indicator is conceptually clear, has an internationally established methodology and standards are available, but data are not regularly produced by countries.
    				\medskip
    				
    				\textbf{Tier III:} No internationally established methodology or standards are yet available for the indicator, but methodology/standards are being (or will be) developed or tested.

	       \subsubsection{Agenda 2030 Indicator 9.1.1.}
	            
	            The main focus of this thesis is on SDG 9, indicator 1.1: \textit{Proportion of the rural population who live within 2 km of an all-season road} (see chapters X, X and X). Until December 31 of 2018 indicator 9.1.1 was classified as a tier III indicator. Today it is classified as a tier II indicator (UN Statistics Division, \citeyear{unitednationsstatisticsdivision2019b}).
